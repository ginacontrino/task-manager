# Task manager

### Getting started

Run `npm i` 

Which installs vue.js and further dev dependencies. Then build the project with webpack by running:


`npm run watch` followed by `php -S localhost:8000`


Now visit http://localhost:8000 and get started by adding boards, columns and tasks!

 
### Testing
Having all dependencies installed, all you need to do is run:
`npm run tests`

The tests can be found in `__tests__`
